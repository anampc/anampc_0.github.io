 <font size="1"> Coral cover is declining worldwide due to multiple interacting threats. We compared the effects of elevated nutrients and temperature on three Caribbean corals: *Acropora cervicornis*, *Orbicella faveolata*, and *Siderastrea siderea*. Colonies hosting different algal types were exposed to either ambient nutrients (A), elevated NH4 (N), or elevated NH4 + PO4 (N+P) at control temperatures (26 °C) for > 2 months, followed by a 3-week thermal challenge (31.5 °C). A. cervicornis hosted *Symbiodinium* (*S. fitti*) and was highly susceptible to the combination of elevated nutrients and temperature. During heat stress, *A. cervicornis* pre-exposed to elevated nutrients experienced 84%-100% mortality and photochemical efficiency (*Fv/Fm*) declines of 41-50%. In comparison, no mortality and lower *Fv/Fm* declines (11-20%) occurred in *A. cervicornis* that were heat-stressed but not pre-exposed to nutrients. *O. faveolata* and *S. siderea* response to heat stress was determined by their algal symbiont community and was not affected by nutrients. *O. faveolata* predominantly hosted *Durusdinium trenchii* or *Breviolum*, but only corals hosting *Breviolum* were susceptible to heat, experiencing 100% mortality, regardless of nutrient treatment. *S. siderea* colonies predominantly hosted *Cladocopium* C1 (C. goreaui), *Cladocopium* C3, D. trenchii, or variable proportions of *Cladocopium* C1 and D. trenchii. This species was resilient to elevated nutrients and temperature, with no significant mortality in any of the treatments. However, during heat stress, *S. siderea* hosting *Cladocopium* C3 suffered higher reductions in *Fv/Fm* (41-56%) compared to S. siderea hosting *Cladocopium* C1 and D. trenchii (17-26% and 10-16%, respectively). These differences in holobiont susceptibility to elevated nutrients and heat may help explain historical declines in *A. cervicornis* starting decades earlier than other Caribbean corals. Our results suggest that tackling only warming temperatures may be insufficient to ensure the continued persistence of Caribbean corals, especially *A. cervicornis*. Reducing nutrient inputs to reefs may also be necessary for these iconic coral species to survive.</font>
