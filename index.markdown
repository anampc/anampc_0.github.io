Hi, I'm Ana. I am a biologist interested in the future of our oceans. My main focus of research has been how ocean warming, acidification, and pollution affect corals and disrupt the coral-algal symbiosis, causing coral bleaching and mortality. I am also trying to identify (environmental and genetic) factors that promote more resistant corals that could survive in our fast changing world.


I use a combination of fieldwork and laboratory experiments to better understand corals' susceptibility and tolerance to these stressors. I collect small coral samples during my expeditions and experiments, which then I analyze with molecular techniques and bioinformatic tools.

I am currently a guest post-doctoral researcher at [NOAA-AOML](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov)
 and an [NRC](https://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/RAP/index.htm) research fellow. 
 I got a Ph.D. from the University of Miami with the [Coral Futures Lab](https://coralreeffutures.rsmas.miami.edu/people/ana-palacio/index.html),
  and a BS degree from Universidad de Antioquia (Colombia). I am also a member of the Coral Reefs Ecology research group at Universidad del Valle.
