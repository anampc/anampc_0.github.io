This is the repository for my personal web [site](https://anampc.github.io/). Thanks to Jonathan McGlone' [post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) I got inspired and made a site from "scratch". However, I ended up cloning and working with his [site](https://github.com/jmcglone) as a base since I am not familiar with  Bootstrap yet and his site was all I needed!.

This site uses [jekyll]: https://github.com/jekyll
